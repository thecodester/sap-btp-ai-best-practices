# Best Practices for Content Filtering

This section provides guidance and examples for content filtering with generative AI models using the SAP AI SDK. Content filtering is a critical process that ensures the quality and relevance of input data. It involves evaluating and selecting data to prevent low-quality or irrelevant inputs from affecting model performance. This process is essential for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of LLMs, especially when they are used for real-time applications or sensitive tasks.
