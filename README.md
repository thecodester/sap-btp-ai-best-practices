## Description

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of best practices and sample implementations for AI-powered applications on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). It serves as a practical guide for developers looking to implement enterprise-grade AI solutions using SAP's AI services and integration with generative AI models.

The examples provided demonstrate how to:

- Securely access generative AI models
- Implement content filtering for AI-generated outputs
- Apply data masking for PII protection
- Create effective prompt templates
- Build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems

Each best practice includes code samples in multiple programming languages (TypeScript, Python, Java, CAP) to support various technology stacks and development approaches.

## Requirements

- SAP Business Technology Platform account
- Access to SAP AI Core service

## Download and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.tools.sap/btp-ai-best-practices/sap-btp-ai-best-practices.git
   cd sap-btp-ai-best-practices
   ```

2. Follow the setup instructions in the README of each specific best practice directory.

   For example, to run the TypeScript example for accessing generative AI models:

   ```bash
   cd best-practices/access-to-generative-ai-models/typescript
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit the .env file with your service key
   npm start
   ```
