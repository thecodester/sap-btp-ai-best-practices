### Description

Regression is one of the most widely used predictive modelling techniques, applied to predict values of continuous numerical attributes or figures, like a price, a cost value, etc. Various regression models for different use cases and different strengths and popularity have evolved. Linear regression, for example, helps to uncover linear relationships, i.e., straight-line relationships, between input (independent) and output (dependent) numerical variables, making it a popular technique for predictive and statistical modeling. Tree-based algorithm implementations like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting Regression have become trending implementations, and proved to create robust models.

### Expected Outcome

The expected outcome is a model that predicts the value of a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. In the case of linear regression, this model is represented by a linear equation that minimizes the difference between predicted and actual values (ground truth).

#### Scenarios
Regression can be utilized in various scenarios, such as predicting car prices based on model characteristics and market trends or predicting house prices using a house's living area (size). For instance, in the figure shown below, variable 'x' represents the set of values of houses' living areas, whereas variable 'y' represents the prices of the houses.

![High-level Reference Architecture](@site/static/narrow-ai/regression/images/scenarios.png)

The continuous values of variable 'y' are predicted by 'h': the function that maps the values of 'x' to 'y'. For simplicity, the figure only illustrates one data attribute of the houses, which is the living area. In this case, the predictor variable 'x' is continuous.

Similar to the previous figure, the following plot shows the input variable (houses' living areas) on the x-axis and the output variable (houses' prices) on the y-axis.

![High-level Reference Architecture](@site/static/narrow-ai/regression/images/graph.png)

The goal is to build a model that takes the living area of a house as input and predicts the house price. The data points in the plot represent observations from the dataset. By fitting a line to these data points, the model is created. The equation of this line is Y = m x + c, where 'm' is the slope of the line and 'c' is the y-intercept, i.e., the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

### High-level Reference Architecture
![High-level Reference Architecture](@site/static/narrow-ai/regression/images/arch.png)

### Calling PAL and APL Functions
- PAL functions can be called through the SQL interface or using the Python or R Machine Learning clients (hana-ml).
- APL functions can be called through the SQL interface or using the Python Machine Learning client (hana-ml).
- The Natural Language Processing functions for Text Analysis, Named Entity Recognition or Part of Speech tagging can be called via PAL functions. In addition, the Text Embedding function can be called via PAL functions as well as the SQL function [VECTOR_EMBEDDING()](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-vector-engine-guide/creating-text-embeddings-in-sap-hana-cloud).
- Both PAL and APL functions can be called out of the box in the HANA Cloud Database Core Container, or as part of the HANA Cloud Elastic Compute Nodes.
- SAP BTP Applications can embed use of PAL or APL functions as part of standard SQLScript design-time artifacts, e.g. multi-target or full-stack CAP applications. Furthermore, usage of PAL and APL functions may also be utilized via applications leveraging Python runtimes and scripts using the Python Machine Learning client (hana-ml).

## <span className="step-number">3</span> <span className="step-title">Key Choices and Guidelines</span>

The success of regression models depends fundamentally on rigorous data preparation and comprehensive model evaluation. Key choices involve selecting appropriate independent variables, ensuring data quality, and verifying assumptions such as linearity, independence, and normality.

For regression specifically, important considerations include:
- Proper feature selection and handling multicollinearity.
- Evaluating model performance using regression-specific metrics like R-squared, MSE, and RMSE.
- Understanding confidence and prediction intervals for assessing uncertainty in predictions.
- Ensuring variables are logically related to the dependent variable.

For a detailed guide on data preparation methodologies, model evaluation metrics (including R-squared, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE), feature selection techniques, and best practices that apply to regression and other ML tasks, please refer to our unified [ML Data Preparation and Model Evaluation Best Practices page](https://sap.sharepoint.com/sites/210313/SitePages/Data%20prep%20and%20model%20evaluation.aspx).

For model selection, some key choices depend on:
- Selecting between an automated regression analysis function using APL (with fewer choices, fast forward results) and expert regression function usage using PAL (wide variety of algorithms, more choices and constraints to be taken care of).
- When using PAL, selecting and probing multiple algorithms using PAL’s AutoML capability for regression or using PAL’s Unified Regression interface, providing a consistent usage experience across all algorithms and improved parameter-search, cross-validation and model evaluation (scoring) interfaces

### Leverage In-Database ML functions from SAP HANA whenever possible
When working with SAP HANA or SAP Datasphere, leveraging in-database capabilities provides the most efficient approach due to minimized data movement and optimized performance. SAP HANA offers multiple approaches:
- **For automated analysis:** Use the Automated Predictive Library (APL) which provides a fast-forward approach for non-expert data scientists. APL automatically handles variable selection, data preparation, variable encoding, missing value handling, outlier handling, binning and banding, model testing, and best model selection.
- **For targeted algorithm selection:** Use PAL (Predictive Analysis Library) functions when you need more control to achieve the best possible model performance. Consider utilizing the Unified Regression functions or AutoML Regression pipelines for improved productivity and easier application integration.

### Anomaly and Outlier Detection
Identifying anomalies or outliers is a critical aspect of building robust machine learning models. These unusual data points can represent data quality issues, unique real-world events, or errors in data collection that might otherwise skew model training and evaluation.

For a comprehensive guide on the methodologies and best practices for discovering anomalies in your data, please refer to our unified [Anomaly Detection Best Practices page](/docs/technical-view/narrow-ai/anomaly-detection).

## <span className="step-number">4</span> <span className="step-title">Implementation</span>
When developing regression models with SAP tools and libraries, the choice of your application's runtime dictates the relevant information. Different approaches can be used to embed the regression scenario artifacts.

### Programming Model Selection Guidelines
When developing regression scenarios with SAP HANA’s Predictive Analysis Library (PAL), consider the following guidelines:

- **Recommended Approach (Data Science Workflows):** Utilize the Python hana-ml library for a streamlined, intuitive experience aligned with standard data science practices, including convenient data manipulation and integration with machine learning workflows. This approach yields best productivity during ML model experimentation until the final model of choice and parameterization has been determined.
- **Alternative Approaches:**
    - **SQLScript database procedures and table functions** are the typical **HANA design-time artifacts** for embedding and invoking PAL and APL procedures into BTP CAP or XSA full-stack applications. Artifact generations from the hana-ml machine learning client in Python is supported.

The final choice should align with your team’s expertise and project requirements.

SAP HANA's Predictive Analysis Library (PAL) algorithms can be directly invoked through SQLScript. This approach is beneficial for:
- **Performance Optimization:** Minimizes data movement by executing directly within the database.
- **Integration:** Allows embedding ML logic within database procedures, views, or calculation views for seamless integration with existing SAP HANA applications.
- **Governance:** Provides a standardized approach within existing database governance frameworks.

When implementing with SQLScript, you'll typically:
1. Create parameter tables with algorithm-specific settings.
2. Prepare input data in the required format.
3. Call the PAL procedure.
4. Process the resulting output tables.
